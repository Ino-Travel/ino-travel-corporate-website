    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Travel Companion App. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to user information and data handling.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users. Our app is designed to function without requiring access to your personal information.</p>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>The only purpose of authentication in our app is to securely show you your personalized travel path. This process does not involve storing or analyzing your personal data beyond what is necessary for authentication.</p>

    <h2>Personalised Travel Path</h2>
    <p>Once authenticated, the app displays the travel path assigned to you. This path is only accessible to you during your trip and is not saved or reused after the trip ends.</p>

    <h2>After the Trip</h2>
    <p>When your trip is complete, the app does not retain any of your information. Your personalized travel path is no longer accessible, ensuring your experience remains private.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not share any information with third-party services. Since we do not collect user data, there is nothing to sell, trade, or disclose.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
    <p>We built this app with privacy as a core principle. You can use the Travel Companion App confidently, knowing that your data remains yours and is never collected or stored.</p>
